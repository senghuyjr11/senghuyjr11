# Hi, I'm Senghuy

I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare at Inje University under the Global Korea Scholarship program. My work focuses on building efficient and reliable AI systems, and I am open to applying AI across diverse domains beyond healthcare. I have a background in both AI research and software engineering, giving me experience in developing solutions from prototype to production.

## About Me
- Skilled in AI model development, optimization, and deployment.
- Professional background in Android native development and backend services using Spring Boot.
- Comfortable working across the AI stack: data processing, model training, optimization, and API integration.
- Interested in AI research and engineering roles that combine technical depth with real-world applications.

## Skills
**AI & Machine Learning**  
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers  
- Computer Vision, NLP, Multimodal Learning, Generative AI  
- Model optimization (quantization, pruning, distillation)  
- Deployment (ONNX, TensorRT, TFLite)

**Software Development**  
- Java/Kotlin (Android native)  
- Spring Boot, FastAPI, Flask  
- REST API design and integration
