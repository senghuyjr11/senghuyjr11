# Hi, I'm Senghuy  

I build **AI systems and software applications**, with experience ranging from research prototypes to production-ready code. My work spans **computer vision, NLP, multimodal learning, and backend/mobile development**.  
Recently, my research has focused on **Agentic AI** — exploring autonomous AI systems that integrate planning, reasoning, and multimodal learning.
